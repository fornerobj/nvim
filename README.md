# My Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration, heavily inspired by [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen)'s configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Neovim installed on your system. If not, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://neovim.io/).


## Features

- **Minimalistic Design:** My configuration focuses on simplicity and efficiency.
- **Plugins:** Utilizes a variety of plugins to enhance Neovim's functionality.
- **Keybindings:** Includes custom keybindings for faster navigation and editing.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fornerobj/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```

2. Run neovim and the plugins should install automatically

3. Restart Neovim for changes to take effect.

## Usage

- **Keybindings:** Check the `init.vim` file for keybindings and configurations.
